#Set Lookup Complexity:

Sets in Python are implemented using hash tables, which provide constant-time average case complexity for lookup operations.
When you perform operations like in membership testing or use methods like add(), remove(), or discard() on a set, Python hashes the element to determine its potential index in the underlying array.

#Solution
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        a=set(nums)
        res=0
        for n in nums:
            if (n-1) not in a:
                length=1
                while(n+length) in a:
                    length+=1
                res=max(res,length)
        return res
