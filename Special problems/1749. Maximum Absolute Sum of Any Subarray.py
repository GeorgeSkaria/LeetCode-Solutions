  '''To maximize the absolute subarray sum, we need to find two prefix sums â€” one that is as large as possible 
  and another that is as small as possible. This is because the sum of any subarray between indices i and j can
  be expressed as prefixSum[j] - prefixSum[i]. The greater the difference between prefixSum[j] and prefixSum[i],
  the larger the absolute sum of the subarray. Thus, to maximize this difference, prefixSum[j] should be as large
  as possible, while prefixSum[i] should be as small as possible.'''
