>Using fixed size codes, we can reduce the size of the transmitting message (we should also pass the table for determining the codes assigned).

>Using variable size codes(Huffman coding),

 -Follows optimal merge pattern (merging files with smaller sizes first)
 -Here, count of each character in the message is considered for merging accordingly
 -After constructing merge tree, assign 0 to left edges and 1 to right edges.
 -From root, assign code for each character.
 -Results in assigning smaller codes for chars with higher frequency, hence reduces cost.
 -Tree/Table should also be transmitted.
